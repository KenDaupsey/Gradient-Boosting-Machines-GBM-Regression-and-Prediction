# Gradient-Boosting-Machines-GBM-Regression-and-Prediction

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) algorithm for regression tasks, specifically for predicting academic performance scores. GBM is a powerful machine learning technique that combines multiple weak models (decision trees) into a strong predictive model.

Project Description
The project involves loading a dataset containing information about students' academic performance, including reading, writing, math, and other relevant scores. It selects the desired features (reading and writing scores) and the target variable (math score), splits the data into training and testing sets, and then trains a GBM regression model using the XGBoost library. The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set, and the mean squared error is calculated to evaluate its performance. Additionally, the project showcases how to use the trained model for making predictions on a new data point.

Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
scikit-learn
xgboost
You can install the required libraries using pip:


Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script containing the code.
The script will load the dataset, select the desired features and target variable, split the data into training and testing sets, train the GBM regression model, make predictions on the test set, calculate the mean squared error, and demonstrate how to use the trained model for making predictions on a new data point.
